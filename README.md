# chernikova-python
Python implementation of Chernikova's algorithm for converting a polytope in implicit representation to a set of generating rays and vertices.


This implements Chernikova's algorithm as described in:
Felipe Fernandez, Patrice Quinton. Extension of Chernikova’s algorithm for solving general mixed linear programming problems. [Research Report] RR-0943, 1988

With the extension described in:
Hervé Le Verge. A Note on Chernikova’s algorithm. [Research Report] RR-1662, INRIA. 1992. inria-00074895

Currently WIP.
